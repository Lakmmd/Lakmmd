Create a Telegram mini-app named "MMD COIN" with the following features:

Top Section:

A header at the top of the screen should display the name of the mini-app, "MMD COIN," centered within a rectangular frame.
Middle Section:

Display an image in the center of the screen that users can interact with.
Each time the image is clicked, it should visibly enlarge and shrink back to its original size to confirm the click action.
Each click should also increase the user's score by one point.
Top Section (Continued):

The user's score should be displayed at the top of the screen, next to or below the "MMD COIN" header.
Bottom Section:

Add a "Boost" button at the bottom of the screen.
This button allows users to increase the rate at which they gain points with each click.
